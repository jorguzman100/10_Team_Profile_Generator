## The challenge

To build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

Main elements:

- [x] CLI application to promt user with team member's information
- [x] Creation of output/team.html with team member's information
- [x] The application must also pass all unit tests

## The development process

In order to accomplish the challenge, the following steps were done:

1. Understand the purpose, and concept of the application.
2. Understand the provided code.
3. Define and code the classes.
4. Run the tests and apply required adjustments.
5. Create functionality.
6. Final review and proper documentation.
7. Create video to explain use of the application.

## The Output

With the described process we were able to create a useful command line interface (CLI) application that promts user information from the CLI and creates an HTML file with team's profiles.
